# Migration Status

## Phase 1: Async Foundation ✅ COMPLETED
- Created `audio_processor.py` for async audio processing via Pub/Sub
- Modified `main.py` to support async processing (controlled by `USE_ASYNC_PROCESSING` env var)
- Added proper error handling and minute refunding
- Created deployment guide (`DEPLOYMENT_PUBSUB.md`)
- Updated FFmpeg to use consistent MP3 encoding (128k bitrate, 44.1kHz, mono) for reliability

## Phase 2: Service Extraction - Telegram Service ✅ COMPLETED
- Created `services/telegram.py` with `TelegramService` class
- Extracted all Telegram API methods:
  - `send_message`, `edit_message_text`, `delete_message`
  - `send_document`, `get_file_path`, `download_file`
  - `answer_pre_checkout_query`, `send_invoice`
- Added connection pooling using `requests.Session()`
- Maintained backward compatibility with wrapper functions
- Updated both `main.py` and `audio_processor.py` to use the service

## Memory Optimization ✅ COMPLETED
- Reduced audio processor memory from 2GB to 1GB (50% reduction)
- Implemented lazy loading of services (initialized once per instance)
- Added garbage collection after file operations
- Optimized FFmpeg settings (mono audio, single thread)
- Upgraded to Gemini 2.5-flash for better performance
- Added optional memory monitoring with psutil

## Phase 2 Continued: Firestore Service ✅ COMPLETED
- Created `services/firestore.py` with `FirestoreService` class
- Extracted all Firestore operations:
  - User management: `get_user`, `create_or_update_user`, `update_user_balance`, `delete_user`
  - User state: `get_user_state`, `set_user_state`
  - Audio jobs: `create_audio_job`, `update_audio_job`
  - Trial requests: `get_trial_request`, `create_trial_request`, `update_trial_request`
  - Logging: `log_transcription`, `log_payment`, `log_oversized_file`
  - Statistics: `get_transcription_stats`, `get_user_transcriptions`
  - Internal state: `get/update_last_trial_notification_timestamp`
- Updated both `main.py` and `audio_processor.py` to use the service
- Maintained backward compatibility with fallback to legacy db client
- All changes are non-breaking

## Phase 2 Continued: Audio Service ✅ COMPLETED
- Created `services/audio.py` with `AudioService` class
- Extracted all audio processing operations:
  - Audio validation: `validate_audio_file` with file size and duration checks
  - FFmpeg conversion: `convert_to_mp3` with standardized settings
  - Transcription: `transcribe_audio` using OpenAI Whisper
  - Text formatting: `format_text_with_gemini` using Gemini 2.5-flash
  - Pipeline processing: `process_audio_pipeline` for complete workflow
  - Audio info extraction: `get_audio_info` using ffprobe
- Standardized audio processing settings (128k bitrate, 44.1kHz, mono)
- Updated both `main.py` and `audio_processor.py` to use the service
- Maintained backward compatibility with fallback implementations
- All FFmpeg operations now centralized with consistent error handling

## Phase 3: User Settings Menu ✅ COMPLETED
- Added user settings infrastructure to Firestore:
  - `get_user_settings` - retrieves settings with defaults
  - `update_user_setting` - updates individual settings
  - Settings stored as nested object in user document
- Implemented `/settings` command with inline keyboard menu
- Created settings for output formatting:
  - Toggle between code-tagged output (`<code>`) and plain text
  - Visual indicator (✓) shows current selection
  - Settings persist across sessions
- Added callback query handlers:
  - `settings_code_on` - Enable code tags
  - `settings_code_off` - Disable code tags (default)
  - `settings_close` - Close settings menu
- Updated output formatting in both `main.py` and `audio_processor.py`
- Backward compatible - users without settings default to code tags disabled
- Added `/settings` to help menu

## Phase 4: Enhanced User Experience ✅ COMPLETED
- Added progress visualization with Unicode progress bars:
  - Visual progress bar: [▓▓▓▓▓▓░░░░░░░░░░░░░░] 30%
  - Shows percentage completion for each stage
  - 5 stages: downloading, converting, transcribing, formatting, sending
- Implemented time estimation:
  - Calculates remaining time based on file duration and processing speed
  - Displays as "~2:30 осталось" or "~5 сек. осталось"
  - Updates dynamically based on actual progress
- Added audio quality/format detection:
  - Pre-checks audio files before processing
  - Detects unsupported formats (AMR, Speex, GSM)
  - Warns about low quality (sample rate < 16kHz or bitrate < 64kbps)
  - Continues processing with warning for low quality files
- Improved error messages with recovery actions:
  - Audio conversion errors: suggests MP3/WAV conversion, standard codecs
  - Transcription errors: suggests checking audio quality
  - Download errors: suggests re-sending the file
  - Generic errors: provides support contact option
- Created utility methods in TelegramService:
  - `format_progress_bar()` - creates visual progress bars
  - `format_time_estimate()` - formats remaining time
  - `send_progress_update()` - sends formatted progress messages
- Enhanced AudioService with `analyze_audio_quality()` method

## Next Steps:

### Phase 5: Performance & Monitoring
1. Add detailed performance metrics tracking
2. Implement request/response time logging
3. Add dashboard for monitoring usage patterns
4. Create automated alerts for failures

### Phase 6: Advanced Features
1. Batch processing for multiple files
2. Language detection and multi-language support
3. Custom formatting templates per user
4. Export to different formats (SRT, VTT, etc.)

## Testing Checklist:
- [ ] Test sync processing (set `USE_ASYNC_PROCESSING=false`)
- [ ] Test async processing (default)
- [ ] Test payment flow
- [ ] Test error scenarios
- [ ] Test admin commands
- [ ] Monitor Pub/Sub queue performance

## Rollback Instructions:
If issues arise, you can rollback by:
1. Set `USE_ASYNC_PROCESSING=false` to disable async
2. Deploy previous version of main.py if needed
3. All changes are backward compatible
