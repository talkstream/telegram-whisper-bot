# Telegram Whisper Bot - Project Documentation

## Overview
A Telegram bot that transcribes audio files using OpenAI Whisper and formats the text using Google Gemini AI. The bot supports async processing via Google Cloud Pub/Sub and includes a payment system using Telegram Stars.

## Architecture

### Core Components
1. **Main Bot (main.py)**: Webhook handler for Telegram updates
2. **Audio Processor (audio_processor.py)**: Async worker for audio processing via Pub/Sub
3. **Services** (services/):
   - `TelegramService`: All Telegram API operations
   - `FirestoreService`: All database operations
   - `AudioService`: Audio processing, transcription, and formatting
   - `UtilityService`: Utility functions (formatting, text processing)
   - `StatsService`: Statistics and analytics operations
4. **Handlers** (handlers/):
   - `CommandRouter`: Routes commands to appropriate handlers
   - `user_commands.py`: User command handlers (help, balance, settings, etc.)
   - `admin_commands.py`: Admin command handlers (status, stats, credit, etc.)

### Key Features
- Async audio processing with Pub/Sub (can be toggled with `USE_ASYNC_PROCESSING`)
- Memory optimized to 1GB (from 2GB)
- User balance system with trial access
- Payment integration with Telegram Stars
- User settings menu for output customization
- FFmpeg audio normalization (MP3 128kbps, 44.1kHz, mono)
- **Video transcription support**: Extract and transcribe audio from video files and video notes

cd telegram-whisper-bot

# Create a new feature branch
git checkout -b feature/new-feature

# Make changes and commit
git add .
git commit -m "feat: Add new feature"

# Push branch and create pull request
git push origin feature/new-feature
```

### Local Testing
```bash
# Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt

# Set environment variables
export GCP_PROJECT=editorials-robot

## Current State Assessment

### ✅ Completed Features:
1. **Inline keyboards** - FIXED in v1.3.0, working perfectly
2. **Batch processing** - Already implemented with media_group_id support
3. **Performance monitoring** - DONE in v1.4.0 with comprehensive metrics
4. **Service architecture** - Professional structure with clean separation
5. **All core features** - Working and deployed

### 🔧 Technical Debt:
1. **Non-blocking pause** - Current 3-second pause still blocks processing
   - Would require async refactoring of progress updates
   - Low priority as current implementation works well
2. **Progress granularity** - Could add more sub-progress within stages
   - Current 5-stage progress is sufficient for users

## Next Development Priorities

### High Priority:
1. **Advanced Admin Features** ✅ (Complete):
   - ✅ User management dashboard with search/filtering
   - ✅ Export usage reports (CSV)
   - ✅ Automated daily/weekly reports
   - ✅ User activity monitoring (via /user command)

### Medium Priority:
3. **Enhanced Batch Processing**:
   - Combined result delivery option
   - Batch cancellation feature
   - Better batch progress tracking

4. **Error Recovery**:
   - Auto-retry for transient failures
   - Better error messages for users
   - Fallback options for API failures

### Low Priority (Future):
5. **Export Formats** - SRT, VTT, DOCX support (on hold)
6. **Language Support** - Russian only per requirements
7. **Non-blocking Progress** - Requires major async refactor

## Summary of June 26-27, 2025 Work

- **Deployments**: All changes deployed to production
- **GitHub**: All versions tagged and pushed

The bot now supports both audio and video transcription with customizable output formatting and clean minute displays.

## Important Technical Notes

### Google AI SDK Migration (CRITICAL)
**As of v1.8.1, the project uses `google-genai` SDK exclusively. DO NOT use deprecated `vertexai` imports:**

❌ **NEVER use these imports:**
```python
import vertexai
from vertexai.generative_models import GenerativeModel
vertexai.init()
```

✅ **ALWAYS use the new SDK:**
```python
import google.genai as genai

client = genai.Client(
    vertexai=True,
    project=PROJECT_ID,
    location='europe-west1'
)

response = client.models.generate_content(
    model="gemini-2.5-flash",
    contents=prompt
)
```

**Why this matters:**
- The vertexai.generative_models API is deprecated and will be removed in June 2026
- We've already migrated twice (v1.7.1 and v1.8.1) due to regressions
- All Gemini API calls must use the google-genai SDK
- The AudioService constructor takes `openai_api_key` string, not OpenAI client or GenerativeModel

### Architecture Guidelines
1. **Service Layer**: All business logic should be in services (AudioService, FirestoreService, etc.)
2. **No Direct API Calls**: Never call OpenAI/Gemini APIs directly in handlers or main.py
3. **Dependency Injection**: Pass API keys, not client objects to services
4. **Memory Optimization**: Use lazy imports in Cloud Functions for heavy libraries

### July 5, 2025 - Major Refactoring (v1.8.0):

#### Architecture Optimization:
1. **Code Reduction**:
   - Reduced main.py from 1,369 to 356 lines (74% reduction)
   - Eliminated ~2,000 lines of duplicate service code
   - Total codebase reduction: ~40%

2. **Modular Structure**:
   - `app/initialization.py` - Service initialization and dependency injection
   - `app/notifications.py` - Notification queue management
   - `app/routes.py` - All Flask route handlers
   - Symbolic links for shared services between deployments

3. **Deployment Optimization**:
   - Optimized `.gcloudignore` to exclude unnecessary files
   - Created `deploy.sh` script for one-command deployment
   - 2-3x faster deployment times
   - 40-50% smaller deployment package

4. **Performance Maintained**:
   - Kept `min_instances: 1` for instant response
   - Warmup time still under 1 second
   - No impact on user experience

The refactoring makes the codebase much easier to maintain while significantly improving deployment speed.

### July 5, 2025 - Vertex AI Migration Fix (v1.8.1):

Fixed the deprecation warning by ensuring complete migration from vertexai SDK to Google Gen AI SDK:
- Removed all vertexai imports (they were accidentally left in v1.8.0)
- AudioService now uses google-genai SDK directly
- No more deprecation warnings in logs

**Note**: The migration was initially done in v1.7.1 but some imports were accidentally reintroduced during the v1.8.0 refactoring. This is now fully resolved.

### July 4, 2025 - SDK Migration Fix (v1.8.1):

#### Fixed Regression from v1.8.0:
1. **Vertexai SDK Removal**:
   - Removed all remaining vertexai imports that were accidentally left during v1.8.0 refactoring
   - Fixed initialization.py to not import or use vertexai modules
   - Updated audio processor deployment to use google-genai SDK
   
2. **Changes Made**:
   - Removed `import vertexai` and `from vertexai.generative_models import GenerativeModel`
   - Removed `vertexai.init()` calls from both main app and audio processor
   - Updated AudioService initialization to use API key string instead of GenerativeModel object
   - Fixed initialization order: MetricsService before AudioService
   
3. **Preventing Future Regressions**:
   - Added comprehensive documentation about SDK migration
   - Clear examples of what NOT to use and what to use instead
   - Architecture guidelines to prevent direct API calls

This ensures the complete removal of deprecated SDK usage that was scheduled for removal in June 2026.

### July 5, 2025 - Minute Display Fixes (v1.8.2):

#### Fixed Fractional Minute Display Issues:
1. **User-Facing Display Improvements**:
   - All minute displays now use `math.ceil()` to show whole numbers
   - Fixed balance display in all messages (balance check, insufficient balance, etc.)
   - Fixed batch processing duration display
   - Fixed refund messages to show whole minutes
