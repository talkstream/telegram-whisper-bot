# Session Summary - June 24, 2025

## Critical Issues Fixed Today

### 1. **Cold Start Problem (16-second delays)**
- **Issue**: Bot was taking 16 seconds to respond after periods of inactivity
- **Cause**: Telegram webhook was pointing to old Cloud Function instead of App Engine
- **Solution**: 
  - Updated webhook URL from Cloud Functions to App Engine
  - Deleted old Cloud Function to avoid confusion
  - Result: Bot now responds in <1 second

### 2. **Deployment Errors**
- **Issue**: App deployment failing with "ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'services'"
- **Cause**: Services folder was missing from root directory
- **Solution**: Copied services folder from audio-processor-deploy to root

### 3. **WSGI Compatibility**
- **Issue**: "TypeError: app() takes 1 positional argument but 2 were given"
- **Cause**: App Engine requires WSGI-compatible application, not Cloud Functions style
- **Solution**: 
  - Added Flask to requirements.txt
  - Converted to Flask application with proper routes
  - Fixed request handling in route handlers

### 4. **/settings Command Error**
- **Issue**: /settings command returning 400 Bad Request for months
- **Error**: "can't parse entities: Can't find end tag corresponding to start tag 'code'"
- **Solution**: Escaped HTML special characters - replaced `<code>` with `&lt;code&gt;`

## Performance Improvements

### Warmup Configuration Enhanced
- Upgraded to F2 instance class
- Added health checks (readiness and liveness)
- More aggressive cron jobs:
  - Warmup every 3 minutes
  - Health check every 2 minutes
- Added Gunicorn workers (2) and threads (4)
- Result: Warmup time ~0.05 seconds

## Current State
- **Version**: v1.0.4 (stable and deployed)
- **All features working**: Commands, transcription, payments, settings
- **Response time**: <1 second (down from 16 seconds)
- **All bot commands functional**: Including the previously broken /settings

## Git Tags Created
- v1.0.2 - Performance improvements and warmup optimization
- v1.0.3 - Critical fixes: Flask integration and services folder
- v1.0.4 - Fixed /settings command HTML parsing error

## Webhook Migration
```bash
# Old webhook (deleted):
https://europe-west1-editorials-robot.cloudfunctions.net/telegram-whisper-bot

# New webhook (active):
https://editorials-robot.ew.r.appspot.com/
```

## Files Modified Today
1. `main.py` - Added Flask integration, fixed HTML escaping
2. `app.yaml` - Enhanced with F2 instance, health checks, better scaling
3. `cron.yaml` - More aggressive warmup schedule
4. `requirements.txt` - Added Flask
5. `CLAUDE.md` - Updated documentation
6. Created `services/` folder in root with all service modules

## Known Issues for Next Session
1. **Average audio duration** - Showing 11.2 minutes for many entries (669s)
2. **Inline keyboards** - Still not implemented, but HTML parsing is now fixed
3. **Progress bar timing** - Formatting stage may appear stuck

## Cost Impact
- F2 instance class costs more than F1 but provides better performance
- Warmup every 3 minutes keeps instance always ready
- Trade-off: Higher cost for much better user experience

## Ready for Tomorrow âœ…
All systems operational, documentation updated, git repository clean.
