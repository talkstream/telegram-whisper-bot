# Session Summary - June 23, 2025

## What Was Accomplished

### 1. **Fixed Critical Issues**
- ✅ Fixed 5-second pause to appear AFTER showing time estimate
- ✅ Fixed minute deduction for all users (including owner)
- ✅ Fixed balance data fetching to always get fresh data
- ✅ Added detailed logging for debugging average audio duration

### 2. **Settings Implementation**
- ❌ Inline keyboards not working (tried multiple fixes)
- ✅ Implemented fallback with text commands:
  - `/settings` - Show current settings
  - `/code_on` - Enable code tags
  - `/code_off` - Disable code tags

### 3. **Keep-Alive Functionality**
- ✅ Implemented automatic scaling (min 1 instance)
- ✅ Added warmup handler
- ✅ Deployed cron job (every 5 minutes)

### 4. **Version Control**
- ✅ Initialized git repository
- ✅ Created v1.0.0 tag (stable release)
- ✅ Created v1.0.1 tag (after cleanup)

### 5. **Codebase Cleanup**
- ✅ Removed all duplicate files
- ✅ Reduced code from 3,795 to 2,559 lines (-33%)
- ✅ Organized project structure

## Current State
- **Version**: v1.0.1 (deployed and live)
- **All core features working**: transcription, formatting, payments, trials
- **Bot stays warm**: automatic scaling + cron job
- **Clean codebase**: no duplicates, well organized

## Important Context for Next Session

### Unresolved Issues:
1. **Inline keyboards** - Multiple attempts to fix failed:
   - Tried fixing JSON serialization
   - Tried different parse_mode settings
   - Issue remains undiagnosed

2. **Average audio duration** - User reports 6 minutes average seems incorrect
   - Added detailed logging but needs verification
